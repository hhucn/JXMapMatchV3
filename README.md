# JXMapMatchV3
The main functions of this java program are:
- automatic map-matching of gps traces on an osm road graph
- allow manual corrections of the matched route
- match network traces onto the matched route
- export the resulting graph-based network characteristics for later use in DataUnion and OSMJoin

JXMapMatchV3 itself is published under the MIT License but makes use of swing and swingx libraries, which are distributed under the LGPL.

The git repo stores the complete eclipse project needed for compilation.
